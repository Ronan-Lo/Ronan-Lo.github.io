  Advances in deep learning have enhanced parameter estimation in item factor analysis (IFA), but traditional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) often lack sufficient expressiveness. To overcome this, we introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), which integrates VAEs with Generative Adversarial Networks via an auxiliary discriminator to relax the standard normal inference assumption. Building on this, we propose Importance‑weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB), which consistently achieves higher likelihoods and comparable mean‑square errors to Importance‑weighted Autoencoders (IWAE) in both empirical and simulated studies, and excels when latent distributions are multimodal. These results indicate that IWAVB can effectively scale IFA to large‑scale and multimodal datasets, fostering deeper integration of psychometric modeling and complex data analysis.
